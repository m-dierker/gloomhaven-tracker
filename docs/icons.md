## Making an animated icon

### Make SVG

- Get Gloomhaven Creator pack, find Element Icons.pdf.
- Open PDF in Illustrator - range on import screen is the page in the PDF.
- Export --> Export As --> SVG --> Save as SVG.

### Animate icon

- Open Adobe Animate, make document of size 560x560 (happens to match icons), Frame Rate 30, HTML5 Canvas.
- Document Settings: Change Stage color to Alpha 0%.
- File --> Import --> Import to Stage and find the SVG.

### Animation notes

For a mesh animation (think moving arms or legs):

- Have to convert to bitmap before it will let you mesh.
